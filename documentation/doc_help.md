# Todo app
## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**Languages Used: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.


Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 


You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.


Once you've added your information to the template, delete this file and rename the `README-template.md` file to `README.md`. That will make it show up as your repository's README file.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
